Classic Spaghetti Carbonara:

Ingredients:
12 ounces spaghetti
4 slices bacon, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 large eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving
Salt and black pepper to taste
Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside.
In a large skillet, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and black pepper.
Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the bacon and garlic. Pour the egg and Parmesan mixture over the spaghetti, tossing quickly to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it.
Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley if desired.
